# professional-portfolio
In this project I started to make it one way from my sketch on the paper to a completely different look. ![Sketch of my project](/assets/images/Drawing.jpg)  I was so pleased with the way things were going that I just kept with it. Had quite a few issues getting the results that I did. Im learning how to use google to a whole different level. You can find my deployed work at https://teller35.github.io/professional-portfolio/. When you click on any of my header and footer links they take you to the corresponding pages or portions of the page. When you click on Run Buddy and Robot Gladiators it will take you to the page that I have personally wrote with help from the boot camp of course. I feel like I have good foundation to build on though this course and to keep pushing the edge.
